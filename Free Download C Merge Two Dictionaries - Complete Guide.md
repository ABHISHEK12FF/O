## Exploring C# Dictionary Merging Techniques

C# provides several ways to merge two dictionaries:

*   **Looping:** Iterate through the second dictionary and add each key-value pair to the first. This is a straightforward approach but can be less efficient for large dictionaries.
*   **`AddRange()` (for `Dictionary<TKey,TValue>` in .NET Framework):** A faster approach, but only available in .NET Framework.
*   **LINQ's `ToDictionary()`:** Create a new dictionary with the combined data. This is a functional approach that can be very concise.
*   **`TryAdd()` (in .NET Core and .NET 5+):** This prevents exceptions if there are duplicate keys when adding from second dictionary.

The course explores all these methods in detail, equipping you with the knowledge to choose the best one for your specific needs.
